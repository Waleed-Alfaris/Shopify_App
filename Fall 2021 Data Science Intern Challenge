Question 1: Given some sample data, write a program to answer the following: click here to access the required data set

On Shopify, we have exactly 100 sneaker shops, and each of these shops sells only one model of shoe. We want to do some analysis of the average order value (AOV). 
When we look at orders data over a 30 day window, we naively calculate an AOV of $3145.13. Given that we know these shops are selling sneakers, a relatively affordable item, 
something seems wrong with our analysis. 

a.	Think about what could be going wrong with our calculation. Think about a better way to evaluate this data. 
    i.	Most purchases are relatively small (1-3 pieces). However, every so often, there is a massive purchase from a Shopify location (i.e, order_id ‘16’). 
    This massive purchase heavily impacts the mean value of the total monthly sales of all locations, which is why we get $3145.13. 
    ii.	Shop 42 and 78 are the main culprits. Shop 42 frequently makes sales of 2000 units and shop 78’s sale prices don’t make sense with the quantities being 
    sold (i.e 25K for a single item) 
    iii.	These ’Outliers’ could be from a couple main factors. One is from human error when inputting the data and the other is that there are these large purchases 
    made every so often. Without further research or communication with the data provider, it would be difficult to determine which case this is. 
    However, if I had to make a guess, I would say that shop 42 could be a large wholesaler making large sales, while shop 78 is erroneously inputting their sales data. 
    iv.	To get a better representation of the average sales of a location we can do a few things. The first thing would be to handle these outliers from the data set so 
    that we can calculate the monthly averages without the outliers. We could drop these rows entirely or replace their values with the mean values for order amount and 
    total items. Another method would be to take the median value (Median Order Value), instead of the mean, in order to get a numerical representation of the sales numbers 
    without the influence of the outliers. One final approach we could use, would be to cluster similar locations together and give mean values for each cluster. This would 
    put the ‘Outlier’ groups into their own cluster and would not impact the value for all the remaining stores. 
    v.	All of these methods would result in insights that are more in tune with what is actually happening.
    
b.	What metric would you report for this dataset?
    i.	I would report the AOV over 30 days after removing the outlier locations 42 and 78.
    
c.	What is its value?
    i.	import pandas as pd

    #import dataset
    src = pd.read_csv('../Documents/DataSets/2019 Winter Data Science Intern Challenge Data Set - Sheet1.csv')

    #drop outlier shops
    drop_shops = [42, 78]
    drop_rows = src.loc[(src['shop_id'] == 42) | (src['shop_id'] == 78)]
    src.drop(drop_rows.index, inplace = True)

    #convert 'created_at' to datetime, then group by month and take mean value of order_amount
    src['created_at'] = pd.to_datetime(src['created_at'])
    src.groupby(pd.Grouper(key='created_at',freq='M')).mean()

    Answer:
    $300.16
